## Summary
Imagine that you are a PokÃ©mon trainer where you have to fill out a form with your name and last name and then select your team of 4 PokÃ©mon to fight in the Battle Tower. The task is to create this form with inputs, button and a **select component** to select these 4 PokÃ©mon and also show the sprites of your chosen PokÃ©mon in a modal.
